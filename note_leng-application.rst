<http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings-articles/university-subject-rankings/top-electrical-engineering-schools-2015>`_.

Canada
------
Of Canada’s 14 representatives, four make it into the world’s top 100: the University of Toronto (20th in the world rankings), McGill University (21st in the world rankings), the University of British Colombia (43rd in the world rankings) and the University of Waterloo (169th in the world rankings).

USA

Among the 300 universities featured in this year’s electrical engineering school rankings, 58 are claimed by the US and 14 by Canada . As well as occupying the top four positions, the US offers 23 more entries in the top 100. Within the top 50, these include the California Institute of Technology (Caltech, 8th in the QS World University Rankings® 2014/15), University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA, 37th in the world rankings), the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech, 107th in the world rankings), Princeton University (9th in the world rankings), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (63rd in the world rankings), University of Texas at Austin (79th in the world rankings), University of Michigan (23rd in the world rankings), Carnegie Mellon University (65th in the world rankings), Columbia University (14th in the world rankings), University of California, San Diego (UCSD, 59th in the world rankings), Purdue University (102nd in the world rankings), Cornell University (19th in the world rankings) and the University of Southern California (131st in the world rankings).

University of Toronto
=====================
from `here
<https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/graduates/admission/requirements/>`_

Due to the large number of applications received, ECE will consider only those applicants with outstanding academic records and references. Typically an overall four-year average of at least A- is required for an applicant to be competitive.

Toefl
-----
For the IBT, applicants must achieve scores of at least 22/30 for each of the Writing and Speaking components of the test, and an overall score of at least 93/120.

Applicants must arrange for their scores to be reported electronically to the University of Toronto (Enrolment Services) by the testing agency. The institution code for U of T is 0982. There is no need to specify a department.

GRE
---
A GRE score is not required. However, applicants who have taken the GRE may enter their scores on the ECE WEB SYSTEM.

Supporting Documents and Information
------------------------------------
Transcripts
References
Statement of Intent and Curriculum Vitae
Declaration of Research Field/Field of Specialization

deadline
--------
January 7, 2016, is the deadline to complete an application for the M.A.Sc. or Ph.D. program.

This deadline applies to all applicants who wish to commence the M.A.Sc. or Ph.D. program in September 2016 or January 2017.
Both online applications must be complete including references by the deadline.
The supporting hard copy documents, such as transcripts, should be mailed by the deadline.

University of British Colombia
==============================
https://www.ece.ubc.ca/admissions/graduate/minimum-requirements

For Admission to the Ph.D.

Applicants to the Doctoral program must have a course and thesis-based Master's degree, similar to our M.A.Sc., as well as a Bachelor's degree, and references must include a detailed letter from the thesis supervisor. Applicants who have completed a course-based Master's program similar to our M.Eng. are not generally eligible for the Ph.D. program and will normally be considered for the M.A.Sc. Applicants who have completed a degree by research only (such as an M.Phil) may have to complete a year of additional coursework as part of their Ph.D. program.


Ph.D. - Applicants for the Doctoral program must have a Master's degree from a national key university with a final standing of 80%.

TOEFL
-----
Other applicants, including Canadians, who have completed their most recent degree in other countries must submit a current, official TOEFL score of 100 on the IBT
If your TOEFL score is within a few points of the minimum score (eg. 95+ on the iBT) you will not be asked to rewrite the test but your lower score will be pointed out on your evaluation and if a professor (or the MEng Program Advisor for MEng applicants) decides to accept your application he/she will have to provide a low-TOEFL rationale. We do not make exceptions for the IELTS score of 7/9. If you have a score of 6.5 we will not accept it.

The most common question we are asked is whether a TOEFL score is necessary if a degree has been completed in a program where the medium of instruction is English. Unless you completed a degree from one of the countries mentioned above we require an official, current language score and will not waive this requirement for you. Your file will not be processed until we receive the score, nor will you be considered for conditional admission, pending further English language training.

GRE
---
All applicants are welcome to submit a GRE score. However, it is strongly recommended that international applicants submit one.

deadline
--------
Jan 15 to begin at September
June 1 to begin at January

For September 2016, although we will try to notify all applicants of the results by the end of February 2016, final decisions could take as long as until the end of March 2016.

McGill University
=================
https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/admissions/graduate/process

Applicants to the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program, in addition to satisfying the requirements for the M.Eng. program, must hold a suitable Master's degree from a recognized university. The applicant must have a high academic achievement: a standing equivalent to a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 3.0 out of 4.0.

TOEFL
-----
TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) minimum acceptable scores are:
iBT (internet based test) - overall score of 100 (no less than 20 in each of the four component scores)

GRE
---
Graduate Record Examinations (GRE)
Submission of GRE (General Aptitude Test) scores is not mandatory.  Applicants who have written the GRE are welcome to submit their scores for consideration.
www.ets.org/gre

McGill accepts only electronic test scores.  It is the applicant's responsibility to ensure that official test scores are sent directly from the testing service to McGill University (Institutional code: 0935).

deadline
--------
September (Fall) Admission
Application form and all supporting documents and test scores must be received by:

January 15th for both international and domestic applicants
January (Winter) Admission
Application form and all supporting documents and test scores must be received by:

September 1st for international applicants
October 15th for domestic applicants
The Department accepts most of its graduate students for September admission.  The chance of acceptance for January admission is significantly lower.  Admission is highly competitive and places are extremely limited.

May (Summer) Admission
The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering does not accept applications for May admission.

Finding a supervisor
--------------------
Every PhD applicant must be accepted as a candidate under the supervision of an Electrical and Computer Engineering faculty member.

Once you have a complete application package, contact potential academic supervisors conducting research in your area of specialization. It is your responsibility bring your performance and record to the attention of those faculty members under whom you would like to work.
